                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. What type of consulting do you do?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Our consulting is focused on deep transformation. We don’t treat the symptoms, we heal from the roots! This approach involves deconstructing who you think you are to create space for a higher intelligence to emerge and direct who you really are and what you really want before taking steps towards goal fulfillment that feels aligned and energised with this new found deepest sense of self. <br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">2. What is your consulting philosophy?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">a.&nbsp;<strong>Depth</strong>: Every challenge you perceive in your outer world is rooted in your inner world.<br><br>b.&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>: Powerful clear action and true freedom of choice can only come from a space of emptiness - you can only paint freely on a blank canvas.<br><br>c.&nbsp;<strong>Revolutionary</strong>: Moving beyond self-help concepts, quick fixes, coping mechanisms and imposing “positive thinking”.<br><br>d.&nbsp;<strong>Action-Oriented</strong>: No more information. Providing practical, personalised, step-by step application. Walk out transformed, not informed.<br><br>e.<strong>&nbsp;Client Centred</strong>: Genuine, consistent support and accountability - someone who holds you to achieving your goals even when you are clouded by doubt.</p>
                                                   <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">3. How is your consulting different from coaching, therapy or mentoring?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Unlike mentoring, we don't seek to be another voice of authority in your head or to impose another layer of conditioned belief. We don’t want you to need us. Instead, we provide you with the tools and create the conditions for you to begin hearing and trusting your highest intelligence, supporting you as you navigate this new way of living.
<br>
<br>Unlike therapy, we don’t focus on the past, explore your emotional history, offer coping mechanisms, or impose positive thinking. We don’t seek to improve your story about yourself, we show you how powerful you can be when you allow any story to be in a larger space of awareness. Our consulting is about investigating thoughts and emotions, experiencing their limitations, allowing them to dissolve naturally while discovering a practical and more powerful way of living beyond thoughts and emotions. 
<br>
<br>Unlike coaching, we go beyond acquiring skills, shifting mindsets/values, achieving goals, or seeking technical advice to achieve your dreams. Many coaching schools encourage replicating the skill sets, habits, mindsets and tools that have worked for the world’s top performers, without going into the internal trade offs and costs of these habits, mindsets and tools. What if these glorified mindsets and skillsets don’t energise you or feel natural to you? We want you to take action to fulfill your goals in a way that feels authentic and effortless for you. A transformational journey is not just about results, we want you to enjoy the journey just as much! 
<br>
<br>We do not want you to wear more masks or identify with more labels, nor do we encourage ego-driven wants and needs. We create a space for you to see for yourself what lies beyond. All of this is experienced, not theorized. </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">4. When should I start?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">How soon do you want your life to change? Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you should start when life settles down. From what we have seen, life only settles down once you invest in the inner work. This is the work that fuels all your other goals, commitments and responsibilities. <br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">5. I have so many problems. Where do I begin?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Start with what feels the heaviest. As the program progresses, you will notice that a way to navigate anything will organically pave itself.<br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">6. How do I know this will work?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Our methods are rooted in timeless eastern and western principles and practices that have consistently delivered results - not just in the lives of those we’ve consulted, but in our own lives, and in the lives of many elevated beings throughout history. This work is not experimental; it is proven, refined, and unfailing when approached with dedication and sincerity.<br><br>While no transformation is instant or passive, when you bring an open mind and genuine discipline to the process, a new way of living becomes not just possible - but inevitable. The power of this work doesn’t lie in blind belief, but in your willingness to show up. And when you do, real and lasting change begins to unfold. See our Testimonials page for specific results.&nbsp;<br></p>
                                 <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">7. Who is an ideal client?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Anyone at least 15 years of age who is open and willing to commit to living a more effective and purposeful life.<br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">8. Is there a minimum age limit for this?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Yes - 15 years old.&nbsp;<br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">9. Do you offer a free consultation or trial session?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We offer a free clarity call to discuss how the programmes can serve your needs. We also provide an immediate 100% money-back guarantee (no questions asked!) after the first session if you find that this is not for you. So yes, effectively, a free trial session.<br></p>
                                   <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">10. Do I need to be spiritual or religious for your programs?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Not one bit. The transformation may be quicker if you believe that there is a greater intelligence or life force at play in the universe but results will happen <em>irrespective </em>of your belief if you consistently apply the tools and practices taught. <br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">11. How is conscious manifestation different from readily available manifestation techniques?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Conscious manifestation moves beyond affirmations, “faking it till you make it”, vision boards and visualisations. These may give you some success as the mind is a powerful machine but does not provide sustained happiness and may create stress and feel burdensome. For instance, the "masks" you wear through visualisations and affirmations might offer a period of confidence, but without deep inquiry into the barriers within yourself, this sense of empowerment is fragile, feels forced and susceptible to collapse. True and lasting self-confidence that is embodied in every cell of your being can only emerge effortlessly when you are in touch with your highest intelligence, which is the core of our approach.<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We have three different programmes, depending on whether you are looking to address your inner-economy or both your inner and outer economies, and the extent of consulting you are looking for. Please see the <a href="wholenomics-programmes.html" class="text-secondary text-primary">Programmes </a>page.</p>
                                 <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">2.&nbsp;Is it group or individual consulting? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We can consult up to four people in our Essence and Foundation programmes. The Mastery programme is done individually.

                                    <li style="color:#998974;">struggling to manage thoughts and emotions
                                    </li>

                                    </li>
                                    <li style="color:#998974;">looking to maximise your potential 
                                    </li>

                                    <li style="color:#998974;">struggling with addictions, trauma or burnout 
                                    </li>
                                    <li style="color:#998974;">seeking to strengthen your intuition 
                                    </li>

                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">4.&nbsp;How can I best prepare for the programme? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Without second guessing. If you have somehow been brought this far (to this website),it's time to trust what's calling for your attention. Pick areas that you want to focus on and come with an open mind, ready to explore new possibilities. Be fully committed to the process, with a deep willingness to transform your life. The more you engage, with openness and sincerity, the faster the results.&nbsp;<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">5.&nbsp;Can we space out the consulting sessions so they are not weekly? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The sessions are intentionally designed to be weekly so that you experience the full power and transformation that this journey offers. Think of this work like having a personal trainer - each session builds on the last, creating momentum and clarity. When sessions are delayed or skipped, it becomes much harder to stay connected, focused, and in flow. Just like missing a week at the gym, it can set back your progress and make it harder to get back on track.<br><br>Consistency is key. We want you to get the most out of your investment - without losing the rhythm that fuels real, lasting change.<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">6.&nbsp;Who do I start with - Nira or Kunal? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Nira. Every outer world problem is rooted in an inner world block. One cannot overcome outer world challenges with the same level of awareness that created them.<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">7.&nbsp;How do I know when I am ready to move to the next consultant? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">That is the beauty of the program - we create a space such that the answers reveal themselves. You will know, and so will we.<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">8.&nbsp;How many sessions must I do before I notice the impact of the program? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Almost all our clients have felt an impact as early as their first session.&nbsp;<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">9.&nbsp;What results can I expect? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Internally, the program fosters a sense of unshakeable self-confidence, renewed purpose, and inner peace - even in the face of uncertainty. It empowers individuals to identify goals which align with their truest self, achieve those goals with clarity, energy, and a sense of joy, while also freeing them from limiting thoughts, emotions and compulsions. Participants often experience more fulfilling work, heightened creativity, healed relationships and a powerful sense of connectedness and influence with others.<br><br>Externally, the program offers practical, tailored solutions rooted in real-world insights from leading organizations like Amazon and HSBC, and Kunal’s personal self-taught methods which led to financial freedom at 35. It provides step-by-step guidance for navigating challenges and personalized tools and templates for success, with an accountability partner to help maintain momentum and remove roadblocks.<br> </p>

                                    They absolutely are. Confidentiality is a cornerstone of our consulting practice. There will be no recording of the sessions without your express permission. Only the consultant(s) are privy to the details of your journey. You will never be asked to share anything you're not ready to share. Your trust is of utmost importance to us.</p>

                                    As with all our programs, your confidentiality is a top priority. The following measures are implemented to foster a safe environment where openness is critical and trust is upheld as a shared and non-compromisable collective responsibility: <br></p>

                                    <li style="color:#998974;">Each client has the right to choose how much they wish to share. While openness is highly encouraged to derive maximum benefit from the program, there is no pressure to disclose beyond what feels safe and true.

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Our consulting is focused on deep transformation. We don’t treat the symptoms, we heal from the roots! This approach involves deconstructing who you think you are to create space for a higher intelligence to emerge and direct who you really are and what you really want before taking steps towards goal fulfillment that feels aligned and energised with this new found deepest sense of self. <br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">2. What is your consulting philosophy?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">a.&nbsp;<strong>Depth</strong>: Every challenge you perceive in your outer world is rooted in your inner world.<br><br>b.&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>: Powerful clear action and true freedom of choice can only come from a space of emptiness - you can only paint freely on a blank canvas.<br><br>c.&nbsp;<strong>Revolutionary</strong>: Moving beyond self-help concepts, quick fixes, coping mechanisms and imposing “positive thinking”.<br><br>d.&nbsp;<strong>Action Oriented</strong>: No more information. Providing practical, personalised, step-by step application. Walk out transformed, not informed.<br><br>e.<strong>&nbsp;Client Centred</strong>: Genuine, consistent support and accountability - someone who holds you to achieving your goals even when you are clouded by doubt.</p>
                                                   <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">3. How is your consulting different from coaching, therapy or mentoring?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Unlike mentoring, we don't seek to be another voice of authority in your head or to impose another layer of conditioned belief. We don’t want you to need us. Instead, we provide you with the tools and create the conditions for you to begin hearing and trusting your highest intelligence, supporting you as you navigate this new way of living.
<br>
<br>Unlike therapy, we don’t focus on the past, explore your emotional history, offer coping mechanisms, or impose positive thinking. We don’t seek to improve your story about yourself, we show you how powerful you can be when you allow any story to be in a larger space of awareness. Our consulting is about investigating thoughts and emotions, experiencing their limitations, allowing them to dissolve naturally while discovering a practical and more powerful way of living beyond thoughts and emotions. 
<br>
<br>Unlike coaching, we go beyond acquiring skills, shifting mindsets/values, achieving goals, or seeking technical advice to achieve your dreams. Many coaching schools encourage replicating the skill sets, habits, mindsets and tools that have worked for the world’s top performers, without going into the internal trade offs and costs of these habits, mindsets and tools. What if these glorified mindsets and skillsets don’t energise you or feel natural to you? We want you to take action to fulfill your goals in a way that feels authentic and effortless for you. A transformational journey is not just about results, we want you to enjoy the journey just as much! 
<br>
<br>We do not want you to wear more masks or identify with more labels, nor do we encourage ego-driven wants and needs. We create a space for you to see for yourself what lies beyond. All of this is experienced, not theorized. </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">4. When should I start?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">How soon do you want your life to change? Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you should start when life settles down. From what we have seen, life only settles down once you invest in the inner work. This is the work that fuels all your other goals, commitments and responsibilities. <br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">5. I have so many problems. Where do I begin?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Start with what feels the heaviest. As the program progresses, you will notice that a way to navigate anything will organically pave itself.<br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">6. How do I know this will work?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Our methods are rooted in timeless eastern and western principles and practices that have consistently delivered results - not just in the lives of those we’ve consulted, but in our own lives, and in the lives of many elevated beings throughout history. This work is not experimental; it is proven, refined, and unfailing when approached with dedication and sincerity.<br><br>While no transformation is instant or passive, when you bring an open mind and genuine discipline to the process, a new way of living becomes not just possible - but inevitable. The power of this work doesn’t lie in blind belief, but in your willingness to show up. And when you do, real and lasting change begins to unfold. See our Testimonials page for specific results.&nbsp;<br></p>
                                 <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">7. Who is an ideal client?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Anyone at least 15 years of age who is open and willing to commit to living a more effective and purposeful life.<br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">8. Is there a minimum age limit for this?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Yes - 15 years old.&nbsp;<br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">9. Do you offer a free consultation or trial session?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We offer a free clarity call to discuss how the programmes can serve your needs. We also provide an immediate 100% money-back guarantee (no questions asked!) after the first session if you find that this is not for you. So yes, effectively, a free trial session.<br></p>
                                   <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">10. Do I need to be spiritual or religious for your programs?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Not one bit. The transformation may be quicker if you believe that there is a greater intelligence or life force at play in the universe but results will happen <em>irrespective </em>of your belief if you consistently apply the tools and practices taught. <br></p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">11. How is conscious manifestation different from readily available manifestation techniques?</p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Conscious manifestation moves beyond affirmations, “faking it till you make it”, vision boards and visualisations. These may give you some success as the mind is a powerful machine but does not provide sustained happiness and may create stress and feel burdensome. For instance, the "masks" you wear through visualisations and affirmations might offer a period of confidence, but without deep inquiry into the barriers within yourself, this sense of empowerment is fragile, feels forced and susceptible to collapse. True and lasting self-confidence that is embodied in every cell of your being can only emerge effortlessly when you are in touch with your highest intelligence, which is the core of our approach.<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">4.&nbsp;How can I best prepare for the programme? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Without second guessing. If you have somehow been brought this far (to this website),it's time to trust what's calling for your attention. Pick areas that you want to focus on and come with an open mind, ready to explore new possibilities. Be fully committed to the process, with a deep willingness to transform your life. The more you engage, with openness and sincerity, the faster the results.&nbsp;<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">5.&nbsp;Can we space out the consulting sessions so they are not weekly? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The sessions are intentionally designed to be weekly so that you experience the full power and transformation that this journey offers. Think of this work like having a personal trainer - each session builds on the last, creating momentum and clarity. When sessions are delayed or skipped, it becomes much harder to stay connected, focused, and in flow. Just like missing a week at the gym, it can set back your progress and make it harder to get back on track.<br><br>Consistency is key. We want you to get the most out of your investment - without losing the rhythm that fuels real, lasting change.<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">6.&nbsp;Who do I start with - Nira or Kunal? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Nira. Every outer world problem is rooted in an inner world block. One cannot overcome outer world challenges with the same level of awareness that created them.<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">7.&nbsp;How do I know when I am ready to move to the next consultant? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">That is the beauty of the program - we create a space such that the answers reveal themselves. You will know, and so will we.<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">8.&nbsp;How many sessions must I do before I notice the impact of the program? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Almost all our clients have felt an impact as early as their first session.&nbsp;<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">9.&nbsp;What results can I expect? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Internally, the program fosters a sense of unshakeable self-confidence, renewed purpose, and inner peace - even in the face of uncertainty. It empowers individuals to identify goals which align with their truest self, achieve those goals with clarity, energy, and a sense of joy, while also freeing them from limiting thoughts, emotions and compulsions. Participants often experience more fulfilling work, heightened creativity, healed relationships and a powerful sense of connectedness and influence with others.<br><br>Externally, the program offers practical, tailored solutions rooted in real-world insights from leading organizations like Amazon and HSBC, and Kunal’s personal self-taught methods which led to financial freedom at 35. It provides step-by-step guidance for navigating challenges and personalized tools and templates for success, with an accountability partner to help maintain momentum and remove roadblocks.<br> </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text quote mbr-bold mbr-fonts-style display-7">10.&nbsp;Do you have testimonials from past clients? </p>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Absolutely - please see the <a href="testimonials.html" class="text-secondary text-primary">Testimonials</a> page. If you would like to know more from previous clients, we can request some time from those that have consented to this, and would be happy to connect you.<br> </p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">You will have the tools and the support of the community to navigate issues after you have completed the program. Helping you live your best life is our life’s purpose.<br> </p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                                    They absolutely are. Confidentiality is a cornerstone of our consulting practice. There will be no recording of the sessions without your express permission. Only the consultant(s) are privy to the details of your journey. You will never be asked to share anything you're not ready to share. Your trust is of utmost importance to us.</p>

                                    As with all our programs, your confidentiality is a top priority. The following measures are implemented to foster a safe environment where openness is critical and trust is upheld as a shared and non-compromisable collective responsibility: <br></p>

                                    <li style="color:#998974;">Each client has the right to choose how much they wish to share. While openness is highly encouraged to derive maximum benefit from the program, there is no pressure to disclose beyond what feels safe and true.
